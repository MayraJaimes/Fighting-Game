# Heroes VS Villains

## Overview

This is a fun and interactive game that gives the user the opportunity to choose a hero and then fight against all the available villains until either the user gets to 0 health points or until all the villains get to 0  health points.

## Description

When the game starts, the user will choose a character by clicking on a hero's picture. The user will fight as that character for the rest of the game. The user must then defeat all of the enemies that are on the right side of the screen. 

The user chooses an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture. Once the user selects an opponent, they are both in the `battle area` ready to fight. 

The user will now be able to click the `attack` button. Whenever the user clicks `attack`, their character damages the enemy. The enemy will lose `HP` (health points). The health points is equal to the hero's attack power which is unknown but doubles itself everytime the hero attacks.

These points are displayed at the bottom of the hero's picture. The enemy character will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, the user's character will lose some of their `HP`. These points are shown at the bottom of the player character's picture. 

The user will keep hitting the attack button in an effort to defeat their enemy. When the hero's `HP` is reduced to zero or below, the enemy is removed from the `battle area`. The user character now will have to choose a new enemy to fight. The user wins the game by defeating all enemy characters. The user loses the game if their character's `HP` falls to zero or below.

After the game is completed, the user has the opportunity to play the game all over again!
