# RPG-Fighting Game

This is a fun and interactive game. The app dynamically updates the HTML pages with the jQuery library.

Here's how the app works: When the game starts, the player will choose a character by clicking on a hero's picture. The player will fight as that character for the rest of the game. The player must then defeat all of the enemies that are on the right side of the screen. The player chooses an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture. Once the player selects an opponent, they are both in the `battle area` ready to fight. The player will now be able to click the `attack` button. Whenever the player clicks `attack`, their character damages the enemy. The enemy will lose `HP` (health points). These points are displayed at the bottom of the hero's picture. The enemy character will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, the player's character will lose some of their `HP`. These points are shown at the bottom of the player character's picture. 

The player will keep hitting the attack button in an effort to defeat their enemy. When the hero's `HP` is reduced to zero or below, the enemy is removed from the `battle area`. The player character now will have to choose a new enemy to fight. The player wins the game by defeating all enemy characters. The player loses the game if their character's `HP` falls to zero or below.
